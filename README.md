# cipher_stuff

My son got a book about ciphers and now he keeps writing, or asking me to write, coded messages. I'm too lazy to do that by hand so I'll write scripts that do the work and put them here from time to time.

## Scripts
- caesar_cipher.py 
- rail_fence_cipher.py
- symbol_replacements.py
- transposition_cipher.py
